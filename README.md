## Ideas

- Upgrade airports gives that airport the ability to handle more routes
- You should be able to reasign an airplane you own to to run between any two cities where the airport has space at their gates
- The demand between cities should be inversely proportional to the inconvience of flying through the network
- Your reputation should diminish the longer you have inconvient routes and aren't meeting demand
- Measure stockholder satisfaction in some form
